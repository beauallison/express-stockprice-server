## Assumptions

After reviewing the requirements, and inspecting both the MongoDB collection and respective APIs, my assumptions in relation to the project are as followed:

- Present a card per company, not just Microsoft
- Only present companies that have complete data sets. This means:
	- A company name
	- A valid ticker code
	- A price and it's unit type
	- A story feed URL and at least one story
